        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to browse the
            few links in the navigation bar above. Please do not click
            the last link.
        </p>
        <h2>It Would be Difficult</h2>
        <p>The last link in the navigation bar is much smaller and
            a different color than the other links. Look at all
            those (3) nice, <i>other</i>, easy-to-click links! Please
            click one of those if you must navigate this site.
        </p>
        <h2>It's Dangerous</h2>
        <p>Look, I didn't want to have to say this, but the last link is actually very
            dangerous to click. Imagine the worst thing that can happen on the internet.
            This would be worse. Leave it alone. Please.
